#ScaleArc_MySQL_perf_benchmark

``Whitepaper_ScaleArc_MySQLNDBcluster.pdf``
This white paper is aimed at measuring the benifits of use of ScaleArc with Mysql NDB cluster for performance improvement using caching mechanism in ScaleArc. The tests were done at GS lab environment with the use of Sysbench OLTP.lua traffic.

We have made available raw test data, server configurations, R-graph scripts in this repository.
